            <p>
                After being exposed to programming while studying Biology and Economics at Stanford, I took a wandering path on the Professional Squash Association World Tour. After becoming one of the top 5 ranked Americans on the Tour, I retired in July 2017 and began to explore life off the squash court. I found my way to a career in coding, because I liked the idea of being able to take a project all the way from conception to reality. I continue to embrace each day as an opportunity to develop my skills and am interested in joining a team that embraces a growth mindset in everything they do. When I'm not coding or on a squash court, I love being outdoors, whether it's hiking in the Sierras, playing in Golden Gate Park, or biking through the Marin Headlands.
