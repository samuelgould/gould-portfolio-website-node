                Silicon Valley loves a good failure story. Thomas Edison, and his 10,000 wrong ways to make a light bulb, is the patron saint of tech. And working in tech I’m surrounded by the stories of founders who persevered through each challenge because of their grit, tenacity, and determination. Every company seems to have their origin story of how they created genius out of the ashes of failure.

                    Sure, it’s true that Steve Jobs was ousted as CEO of Apple in 1985, but that only became an interesting story because of his comeback. The tech community only tells it to set the stage for how incredible it was when Jobs returned as CEO in 1997 with Apple on the brink of insolvency and turned it into the first trillion-dollar company. There are millions of start up stories that never get told, because they don’t involve a comeback and instead are ultimately about failure.

                <br />
                <p>
                    The reality is that in the tech community, when you’re failing, you’re not supposed to talk about it. The point of failure is to be able to have a clever anecdote years later to inspire future entrepreneurs. In the moment though you’re supposed to keep quiet, put your head down and work harder until you figure it out. Or more likely, end up broken and empty, and give up.

                <h3>If I’m already getting an A, what do I have to worry about?</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                    As I’ve reflected over this past month, a new beauty of giving myself the A has emerged -- if I’m already getting an A, what do I have to worry about? So last week when I had my weekly 1-on-1 with my manager, Ben, I decided to put this newly found comfort to the test and be candid. I decided not to put the spin on the last week and instead tell him the truth: I was failing. I didn’t know how to do my job and was having to ask my teammates to do the work instead. This was hard to admit. There wasn’t a rainbow in the midst of this storm. There was no takeaway. There was just the truth. I felt terrible. I felt like I was performing terribly.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    As I opened up about my anxiety and frustration something amazing happened. Ben named all of my current fears as those of his past. He bluntly acknowledged my limitations as an engineer and then spoke to all the reasons I was still a valuable member of the team. It was a perspective-changing conversation, and it all stemmed from being willing to be vulnerable and admit my failure. This was a moment of breaking out of my downward spiral.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Unfortunately that is not how the downward spiral usually ends up. Speaking from my own experience, I know that when things are not going well, I become frustrated. I start to blame myself for my lack of intelligence, lack of effort, or lack of focus. I get caught up thinking about all the things I lack, which only distracts me further from my end goal. Then I get frustrated with myself for getting distracted by all the things I lack, which only further impacts my ability to perform. In the end I’m an anxious mess, spending the majority of my mental energy trying not to lose my composure, and I ultimately end up giving up on whatever task was at hand.

                <h3>Leading from any chair</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                    I want to shape communities where people feel comfortable sharing their failures. I think by opening up about our struggles to those around us we are able to learn from their experiences. Even if opening up about struggles doesn’t change the results, it still provides an opportunity to gain perspective about what you’re dealing with and to understand that even when failure doesn’t lead to an eventual success, it can be okay. It is about having the right attitude around accepting failure and knowing how to live through it and learn from it. 
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    I see this as an opportunity to practice leading from any chair, because by modeling this behavior I believe I can help change the stigma around failure. As the most junior engineer on my team, I still think I can bring this mindset to my workplace. Among my peers at Berkeley I don’t have a leadership role, but I am confident this isn’t an approach to life that needs to be mandated from those in charge. I don’t need to wait to be an engineering manager or to start my own company; I need to simply start opening up when things are going wrong for me.

                    As I think about this leadership challenge, I’m aware that going from not talking about failure to sharing openly in the moment when I’m failing will not be easy. I’m nervous about what people will think of me if I’m constantly talking about my failures. I’m worried that they will start to associate me with failing. And being aware of my hesitation, I know it’s important to think strategically about how I go about changing the failure stigma. I need to be the authentic leader who can comfortably talk about my struggles and invite others into a space where they can talk about theirs.

                    My leadership practice starts at home with my relationship with my fiance. She is the most important person in my life, and still there are times I feel like I’m failing her. My usual approach is to use those experiences as motivation to be a better partner. But at the same time there are moments when my anxiety from failing her tears at me inside. Since I know she will meet my candor with love and support, I want to start confronting my failures with her. By beginning with a receptive relationship where I know this mindset shift will be met with positivity, I can challenge my own preconceived notions and prepare myself to bring this into the world.

                <p>
                    Similarly, I think my manager, Ben, is the type of person that I can try to build this kind of authentic relationship with. Given that he was a part of my completely unscientific pilot program and received my anxiety with such care and compassion, I believe that he will respond well to this honesty. And I do think there are a lot of people within my communities who are like Ben, who will approach conversations about failure as opportunities to break the downward spiral.

        <div class="info-container">

                <p> 
                    From there, I want to work in 1-on-1 settings, since I think those will generally be a more conducive environment for talking about these counter cultural ideals. I know that if I create a comfortable environment, I will be more relaxed and able to speak with conviction about this uncomfortable topic, which will be more impactful and improve my chances of creating the change I hope to see. Strategically it is also important to identify the people within my communities with whom I can build comfort. These people will be my champions who will support me as I engage with a broader group.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    The final step of living into my authentic leadership will come when I embrace that I can only create the environment where change can be made, but that the members of my various communities will have to choose for themselves if they will be vulnerable. I think the steps I’ve outlined will help prepare me and other leaders within my communities to be more candid about failure, but in the end I just need to start sharing openly. And then we’ll see what happens. But if I take these steps and share my failures with honesty and conviction, I am confident others will see the value in being open during their own challenging times.

                    I will leave you with where my journey with failure began and why it’s so important to me. I spent the majority of my life thinking I wanted to be a priest. After 15 years of following that dream I realized it wasn’t my calling, and I felt completely lost. I didn’t know how to move forward without this path that was so familiar, so I turned to my dad. His advice was pretty direct:
                </p>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <h4>1. Go on a road trip.</h4>
                    <h4>2. Do things that bring you joy.</h4>
                    <h4>3. Have a lot of great failures.</h4>
                    <br />
                <p>
                    If we’re too worried about not making mistakes, we’ll never take the risks that make life worth living. And if we don’t talk about failure in the moment, then we will continue to minimize how common it is. Failure is essential to learning. But if we are taught to hide our failures then how are we ever supposed to learn. So now it’s time for me to make myself uncomfortable by trying to lead my communities in a culture shift of embracing failure. I’m sure I’ll fail a bunch along the way, but if I talk about it and try to learn from it, I’m sure it will all work out in the end and I will be the authentic leader I want to be.
